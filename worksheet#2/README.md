# Image Processing Course - Assignment 2

This repository contains solutions to the second assignment of the Image Processing course.

## Concepts Covered

- **Binary, Grayscale, and Color Images**: Understanding the differences between binary, grayscale, and color images, and how to convert between them.
- **Thresholding and Quantization**: Techniques to convert grayscale images into binary images and the concept of quantization with varying levels of segmentation (parameterized by \( k \)).
- **Image Resizing and Scaling**: Methods for resizing images, including changing dimensions, scaling by a percentage, and adjusting size while maintaining the aspect ratio.
- **Histogram Analysis**: Generating and analyzing histograms for grayscale and binary images to understand the distribution of pixel intensities and how different image types affect histogram shapes.

## Requirements

- Python
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
