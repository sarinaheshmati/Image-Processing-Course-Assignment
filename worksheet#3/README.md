# Image Processing Course - Assignment 3

This repository contains solutions to the third assignment of the Image Processing course.

## Concepts Covered

- **Image Format Conversion and Comparison**: Exploring the differences between PNG and JPEG formats by converting an image and comparing both the image quality and file size.
- **Multi-Image File Formats**: Understanding and implementing methods to store multiple images within a single file, suitable for scenarios like sending documents together (e.g., ID card and birth certificate).
- **GIF Creation**: Creating GIFs from a series of images, emphasizing practical applications such as generating animated content from a sequence of JPEG images.
- **Downsampling Techniques**: Investigating different downsampling methods (such as interpolation, pixel elimination, and averaging) and applying a chosen method without using built-in OpenCV functions.
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Image Annotation**: Processing a scanned document to identify and annotate characters by drawing bounding boxes around them, a key step in OCR workflows.

## Requirements

- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- PIL
