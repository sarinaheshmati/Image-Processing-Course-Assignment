# Image Processing Course - Assignment 4

This repository contains solutions to the fourth assignment of the Image Processing course.

## Concepts Covered

- **Image Segmentation with Region Growing**: Implementing image segmentation to separate different brain tissues (white and gray matter) from the background using the region growing algorithm.
- **Grayscale Conversion**: Converting color MRI images to grayscale as a preprocessing step for segmentation.
- **Seed Point Selection**: Selecting seed points manually for the region growing algorithm to initialize the segmentation process.
- **Thresholding Techniques**: Defining and comparing two thresholding strategies—fixed and dynamic—within the region growing algorithm to control how regions expand.
- **Iteration and Analysis in Segmentation**: Applying the region growing algorithm iteratively, calculating the number of iterations required, and analyzing the segmentation results by comparing the original and segmented images.
- **Interpolation Methods Comparison**: Comparing three different image interpolation techniques—Nearest Neighbor, Bilinear, and Bicubic—to understand their impact on image resizing and quality.

## Requirements

- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
